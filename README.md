ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am @DaveShepperd. I worked for "Atari" from Feb 2, 1976 until March 31, 2003 which was a few months before they closed up shop. I quote the word Atari because when I started there was only one. I worked in the coin-operated game (arcade) division the entire time I was there. Due to various business decisions during that interval, the division of the company's name I worked in changed from Atari Inc to Atari Games Inc to Time Warner Interactive Inc back to Atari Games Inc then finally to Midway Games West Inc. (That first split formed the other Atari: Atari Corp. which produced all what we called the consumer products or those that connected to your home TV set and the Atari personal computers; I never had any involvement with any of those products).

I've been sort of retired since 2003 but occasionally doing some contract work for a few different companies. Mostly now I just do what interests me.

Recently I became aware many of the early Atari arcade game sources were posted to github <a href="https://github.com/historicalsource" target="blank">HERE.</a> and I still had the sources to some of the tool chains we used back then and thought I'd post those here too.

I also posted a couple other little projects that caught my interest those having nothing to do with the game development.
